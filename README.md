# Property Management for Owners & Tenants

PayEase is a simple and efficient platform designed for building owners to manage buildings, flats, tenants, and payments in one place. It eliminates manual record-keeping and brings clarity, transparency, and convenience to both owners and tenants.

## Why PayEase?
Building owners often manage multiple buildings and flats using spreadsheets, notes, or WhatsApp. This leads to:
Missing payment records
Difficulty tracking tenants
No proper structure for managing multiple buildings
Lack of digital proof for rent and flat details

PayEase solves this by providing a clean, organized, and digital workflow for property management.

### What PayEase Offers:
1. Building Management
Owners can add multiple buildings, edit details, upload images, and access all information in one dashboard.

2. Flat Management
Each building can have multiple flats.
Owners can add flats, view them in structured lists, and avoid accidental duplicates.

3. Tenant Management
Tenants can register/login and view their flat details, including assigned rent/price.
A user can be both a tenant and a building owner.

4. Payment Support
PayEase integrates Razorpay (Test Mode) to support digital payment flows, giving tenants a smooth payment experience.

5. Visual Building Gallery
Buildings can store multiple images, allowing owners to maintain a visual record of the property.
